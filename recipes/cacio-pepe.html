        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Cacio e pepe (Pasta cacio e pepe) is an exquisite first course typical of Lazio cuisine; based on very 
        few ingredients: Pasta (usually Tonnarelli or Spaghetti), Pecorino Romano d.o.p. and freshly ground black 
        pepper. According to a specific technique, the famous <em>"pasty pecorino cream"</em> is made, to which 
        the Spaghetti cacio e pepe will be whipped; which will be literally enveloped in a creamy coat of cheese! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        An amazing goodness born by the shepherds of the Roman countryside during their transhumance activities. 
        Today it has become a true staple of Roman and Italian cuisine, beloved all over the world.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>320gr of Spaghetti (or Tonnarelli)</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons of black peppercorns</li>
            <li>200gr pecorino romano cheese d.o.p.</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First prepare the pepper stock: In a saucepan with 500 ml of water add 1 tablespoon whole peppercorns (I recommend enclosing them inside a nylon net or tea utensil to avoid finding them whole after everywhere) in the meantime put water to boil the pasta with salt.</li>
            <li>Then separately grind with a pestle the rest of the pepper.</li>
            <li>Finally grate the pecorino cheese and add 1 tablespoon of warm/fresh pepper stock ( not boiling I recommend ) this step is essential so that the pecorino paste "does not tear" you will have to obtain a grainy, compact and not liquid pecorino paste.</li>
            <li>Then cook the Spaghetti halfway through.</li>
            <li>In a pan toast half of the ground pepper for 30 seconds, add 1 ladle of pepper stock and let it boil for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then add directly to the pan with the pepper, the half-cooked spaghetti and add just enough spaghetti cooking water to risotto them.</li>
            <li>Continue adding a little cooking water until they are creamy and perfectly al dente.</li>
            <li>Finally, when they are perfectly al dente and very creamy, so with a nice velvety base turn off the heat and remove the pan from the heat by letting the temperature drop for a moment 30 seconds, continuing to saute.</li>
            <li>Then add the pecorino paste and turn very well. this will melt on the spaghetti. Only if necessary add a pinch of warm spaghetti cooking water.</li>
            <li>Serve with a generous grinding of pepper!</li>
        </ol>
