        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Amatriciana is a typical pasta dish from the cuisine of Amatrice in the Lazio region beloved all over the world! 
        It consists of pasta: bucatini or spaghetti served with the classic Amatriciana sauce made with peeled tomatoes, 
        guanciale and pecorino cheese. A unique goodness that originated in Amatrice as the shepherds' main meal.
        </p>        

        <p>
            Originally without tomatoes, it was named <a href="gricia.html"> Gricia</a>; only later, when it was imported from America, was it added 
            to the recipe and was thus called <em>"Amatriciana"</em>.

        <ol>

            <li>Heat over high heat ( without adding oil) until they are browned, crispy and golden but not burned and have released all their oil.</li>
            <li>Then drain the pieces of guanciale by patting them dry with a scottex and set them aside in the meantime in the pan with fat left by the guanciale, add the chili pepper.</li>
            <li>Finally add another 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan, let it heat, deglaze with white wine, when it has completely evaporated, a gadd the peeled tomatoes cut into small pieces ( again make a fine pulp of all equal pieces).</li>
            <li>Then let it cook on a moderate flame for about 15 to 18 minutes. Finally, correct the salt.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile place the pasta water with salt.</li>
            <li>Then grate the pecorino cheese separately.</li>
            <li>Finally cook the pasta for about 4 minutes (it just needs to soften).</li>

            <li>Let the pasta finish cooking in the pan by risottoing the bucatini, if necessary add more pasta cooking water to make them creamy.</li>
            <li>At the end of cooking add grated pecorino cheese, stir over low heat to blend everything together, add crispy guanciale, mix everything together.</li>
