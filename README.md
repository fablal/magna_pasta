# magna_pasta
Magna Pasta is a play on words, because "magna" in the majority of the Italian dialects means 'eat', but in Latin means 'great'. I know, Italian and Latin sometimes are not so close as you can imagine.

The website is just a demo, nothing of serious or to take into consideration, it is a sort of cookbook with the main Italian pasta dishes.

This website gives me the opportunity to showcase my skills in designing a website from scratch, just using web standards: HTML and CSS

I hope you enjoy it.
